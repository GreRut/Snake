# 🐍 My Snake Game

Welcome to the **Snake Game**! This classic game is built using Python's `turtle` module, where you guide a growing snake 🐍 to eat food 🍎 and avoid crashing into walls or yourself! 🧱

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ to control the snake.
- The goal is to eat as much food 🍏 as possible without hitting the walls or your tail.

- The game ends if you crash into the wall or your own tail.
